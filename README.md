## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vikram

I'm a self-taught fullstack web developer with 2+ years of hands-on experience building real-world applications using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

I enjoy creating fast, clean, and user-friendly web apps â€” from dynamic dashboards to publishing platforms. I'm currently expanding into **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, and building **SaaS-style applications**.

ðŸ’¡ I love building tools that solve real problems and sharing my knowledge about **JavaScript**, **web dev best practices**, and developer productivity.

ðŸš€ **Currently working on**: A fullstack project to showcase on GitHub and sharing technical content on LinkedIn.

ðŸ“¬ I'm open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, and developer networking. Letâ€™s connect!
