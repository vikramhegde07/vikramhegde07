# 👋 Hi, I'm Vikram

I'm a self-taught fullstack web developer with 2+ years of hands-on experience building real-world applications using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

I enjoy creating fast, clean, and user-friendly web apps — from dynamic dashboards to publishing platforms. I'm currently expanding into **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, and building **SaaS-style applications**.

💡 I love building tools that solve real problems and sharing my knowledge about **JavaScript**, **web dev best practices**, and developer productivity.

🚀 **Currently working on**: A fullstack project to showcase on GitHub and sharing technical content on LinkedIn.

📬 I'm open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, and developer networking. Let’s connect!
